These include, but are not limited to, energy savings potential and ability to favorably tie-in with moderate temperature, low-intensity energy sources like solar systems and heat pumps. In order to predict and incorporate such attributes of panel systems, a comprehensive, yet simple model is necessary so that the designers will find it practical to use. Part of this model is the heat diffusion in the panel. An analytical heat diffusion model was developed which is applicable to heating and cooling. Sample designs indicated that this model has an accuracy comparable to that of a finite element model and can be used easily by the design engineer for practical purposes."

The developed model is intended to be use for testing and optimization experiments in the design phase of building heating control systems. The proposed approach is tested by implementing in Matlab/Simulink the model of a building with 4 rooms. The obtained results and the advantages of the proposed method are analyzed and presented in the paper."
